	<h1>Align</h1>

	<p>
		A (very) experimental look at recent articles in <a href="http://www.ft.com">FT.com</a>, exploring the visual impact of aligning the search results in novel ways. 
		<br>The 'key text' is used to identify articles (via keyword search) and to align the results.
		<br>It is case sensitive, and the whole thing breaks if there are no matching search results, so choose wisely.</p>

	<form action="/align" method="GET">
		key text: <input type="text" name="text" value="has its own"><br>
	  	<input type="radio" name="source" value="any" checked> any<br>
	  	<input type="radio" name="source" value="title-only"> title-only<br>
		<input type="submit" value="Get and Align">
	</form>

	<p>The code for all this sits at <a href="https://github.com/railsagainstignorance/alignment">github.com/railsagainstignorance/alignment</a>
	<br>The code has very little error handling, and it can not work for an excitingly wide variety of reasons.
	<br>Perhaps the main reason is that this is MyFirstGoProgram.
