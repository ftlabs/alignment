# experimenting with matching words by rhyme

stole a big file of word syllables from http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cmusphinx/code/trunk/cmudict/cmudict-0.7b

documentation: http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict

Its entries are particularly useful for speech recognition and synthesis, as it has mappings from words to their pronunciations in the ARPAbet phoneme set, a standard for English pronunciation. The current phoneme set contains 39 phonemes, vowels carry a lexical stress marker:

* 0    — No stress
* 1    — Primary stress
* 2    — Secondary stress
